texla

A minimal and easily extensible LaTeX parser.

It's **minimal** because it only splits tex without doing anything strange to the sources. 
It breaks down LaTeX into sections, environments, math, commands and plain text, creating a 
simple tree of Blocks objects.

It's **easily extensible** because to support a new command or environment the only necessary code is a 
Python class that defines a new Block. Moreover options and arguments of Latex commands and environments could be parsed with a simple and easy **API**.
